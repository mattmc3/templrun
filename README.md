# tmplrun

My collection of Jinja2 templates for data merging and string generation

## Installation

No install. Just simply clone this repo, set up a Python environment, and go.
1. `git clone https://github.com/mattmc3/tmplrun.git`
1. `python3 -venv .venv`
1. `source .venv/bin/activate`
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Purpose

I got tired of writing editor plugins and Alfred integrations to do simple
string generation. Most editors can call out to a command prompt, and Python's
Jinja2 is an easy to use templating engine, thus this project was born.

## Usage

The scripts use the amazing docopt library, so run any of the scripts with
the `--help` option to seem more.
